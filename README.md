# Phishing_analyzer
used to aid in the process of analyzing and responding to phishing reports that come in via outlook

I have not tested with anyother email platform, like gmail.

You need to have a config file and a signature text file to go with the phishing analyzer.
The config file has notes inside of it that explain any changes you may want to make.
